#NuclearJS addons for React

Addons to quickly help you start up with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) using [NuclearJS](https://github.com/optimizely/nuclear-js)

## Why ?

Right now the last version of NuclearJS (1.1.1) works server side, but is not truly compatible.

The problem lies in the way the reactor is used with the mixin and the suggested architecture. They are simply not useable server side because all are reliant on a singleton reactor, which would mean that different requests server side would share state.

The proposed solution is simple:
  * actions receive the reactor instead of requiring a singleton
  * mixin "receives" the reactor instead of being created with a singleton

Which means that we need a way to pass the reactor around. That way is react context.

So, we use provideReactor to provide the reactor through your rendering tree via react context.

And then you use the nuclearMixin or nuclearComponent that internally use the reactor attached to the context to operate on this reactor.

All that remains is creating a reactor client side (one time) and pass it around, and creating a reactor server side (each requests) and pass it around.

See [documentation](#documentation) and [examples](#examples) to see how to use (you can off course roll your own provideReactor, it's just a basic Higher Order Component helper to inject context).

## Install

`npm install nuclear-js-react-addons`

```javascript
var NuclearAddons = require('nuclear-js-react-addons')

// choose :o
var provideReactor = NuclearAddons.provideReactor;
var nuclearComponent = NuclearAddons.nuclearComponent;
var nuclearMixin = NuclearAddons.nuclearMixin;
```
or
```javascript
// choose :o
import {
    provideReactor,
    nuclearMixin,
    nuclearComponent
} from 'nuclear-js-react-addons';
```

## Documentation

### provideReactor

Helper to help you provide your reactor to a react component tree using react contexts.

Simple App
```javascript
// in a App.js file
var App = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
        <Child/>
    }
});
```

elsewhere
```javascript
var Nuclear = require('nuclear-js');
var reactor = new Nuclear.Reactor();
var provideReactor = require('nuclear-js-react-addons').provideReactor;
// or
var provideReactor = require('nuclear-js-react-addons/provideReactor');
var App = require('./App');
// Wrap your App into a Higher order Component => HoC
var App = provideReactor(App);

// If you don't pass the reactor as a prop you will have a warning
React.render(<App reactor={reactor}/>, someDiv);
```

or decorator pattern (es7)

```javascript
@provideReactor
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <Child/>
    }
}
```

Now the reactor is provided as the reactor key of the react context if you declare
```javascript
contextTypes: {
    reactor: React.propTypes.object.isRequired
}
```

which you won't have to do manually, because both a mixin and a component are available for you to use.

### nuclearMixin

```javascript
var nuclearMixin = require('nuclear-js-react-addons').nuclearMixin;
// or
var nuclearMixin = require('nuclear-js-react-addons/nuclearMixin');
var someNuclearModule = require('./someModule');
var someOtherNucModule = require('./someModule2');

// This component is used in a tree that somehow
// already has a reactor in its context
// maybe through using provideReactor or something else
var Child = React.createClass({
    mixins: [nuclearMixin],

    // you can omit this to simply have access to the reactor in the context
    getDataBindings: function() {
        return {
            foo: someNuclearModule.getters.meh,
            bar: someOtherNucModule.getters.whatever
        };
    },

    render: function() {
        // you can pass it to actions
        var reactor = this.context.reactor;
        // there is your data
        var foo = this.state.foo;
        var bar = this.state.bar;

        return (
            <div>
                {foo}
                </br>
                {bar}
            </div>
        );
    }
});
```

### nuclearComponent
If you prefer to stay away from mixin, there's also a nuclear component to suit your needs. It also support the decorator pattern

Example using the decorator pattern:
```javascript
import { getters } from './someModule';
import { nuclearComponent } from 'nuclear-js-react-addons';

@nuclearComponent((props) => {
    return {
        foo: getters.meh,
        bar: getters.haha
    };
})
class Child extends React.Component {
    render() {
        // get the reactor and your dataBindings
        // from the props passed in from the wrapper
        const {
            reactor,
            foo,
            bar
        } = this.props;

        return (
            <div>
                {foo}
                {bar}
            </div>
        )
    }
}
```

or simply still using es5
```javascript
var nuclearModule = require( './someModule');
var nuclearComponent = require('nuclear-js-react-addons').nuclearComponent;

var Child = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
        // get the reactor and your dataBindings
        // from the props passed in from the wrapper
        var reactor = this.props.reactor;
        var foo = this.props.foo;
        var bar = this.props.bar;

        return (
            <div>
                {foo}
                {bar}
            </div>
        )
    }
});

nuclearModule.exports = nuclearComponent(Child, function(props) {
    return {
        foo: nuclearModule.getters.meh,
        bar: nuclearModule.getters.haha
    };
});
```

##Examples

Additional [examples here](https://github.com/optimizely/nuclear-js/tree/master/examples/isomorphic-flux-chat)

##Tests

Browser tests spin up `npm run browser-tests` it will launch a webpack dev server and open http://localhost:8080/tests.runner.html, change the port with `npm run browsers-tests -- --port=#PORT`.

Node tests needs io.js (because of jsdom@5), run `npm tests` or `npm run watch` for TDD.
